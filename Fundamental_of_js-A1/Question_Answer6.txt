importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names with example using a clear identifier improves code Readability ->

1. Readability: Descriptive variable names make your code easier to read and understand. Developers (including yourself) can quickly grasp the purpose of a variable without needing to analyze the code in detail.

2. Maintainability: Well-named variables reduce the chances of introducing bugs when modifying orextending code. You're less likely to misunderstand the variable's role and make incorrect changes.

3. documentation: Descriptive variable names serve as a form of self-documentation They convey the intent and context of the variable, reducing the need for additional comments.

4. collaboration: When working in teams, clear variable names facilitate communication among developers.Team members can understand each other's code more easily, leading to more efficient collaboration.

5. Error Prevention: Meaningful variable names help prevent errors caused by using the wrong variable or making incorrect assumptions about variable values.

6. code review: during code reviews, meaning ful variables name make it easier for reviewers to provide feedback and indentify potential issues.

Example: 

// Descriptive variable names
let length = 10;     // clearly represents dimensions
let width = 5;
let area = length * width;  // This variable indicates that it stores the result of multiplying the length and width.

function addNumbers(number1, number2) {   //  These parameter names make it clear that they are numbers to be added.

    return number1 + number2;
}

let sum = addNumbers(length, width);

console.log(area); // Outputs: 50
console.log(sum); // Outputs: 15
