* importance of comment in js -> 

There are two type of comment we used in coding to make aur code more readable and understandable . There are two types of comment we going to use in over all journey

1. single line comment -> 

Use double slashes (//) to create single-line comments. Anything after // on the same line is considered a
comment and is not executed by the JavaScript interpreter.

Example -> 

// single line comment is here 
let name = "shree shivay namastubhyam"


2. Multi line comment ->

Use /* to begin a multi-line comment and */ to end it. Everything between these symbols is treated as a
comment, allowing you to write comments spanning multiple lines.

Example ->


/* 
This is mlti line comment . It is used to comment not only one line but also we can comment far away of one line comment .

*/
